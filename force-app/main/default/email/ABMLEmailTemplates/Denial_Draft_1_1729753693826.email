You are in receipt of contract notes margin statement and statement of accounts to your registered email id on a regular basis.</span><br />
<span style="line-height:115%">The contract notes sent to your registered email address clearly indicates the purchase and sale value of various derivative contracts including intra â€“ day transactions and a simple perusal of the same would provide the details of profits or losses sustained. The margin bills disseminated would clearly give you a picture of the status of shares offered as margin and the outstanding debits in your account.</span><br />
<span style="line-height:115%">The above said reports clearly explain the open position available in your account and the outstanding debit available in your account before the disputed period. In addition to that margin bill will clearly explain the MTOM profit/loss posted in your account on daily basis.</span><br />

<span style="line-height:115%">In addition to that you have also continued to provide confirmations on trade confirmation calls and have been actively participating in the decision-making process. Only upon sustaining losses you are seeking to dispute the said transactions.</span><br />
<span style="line-height:115%">The very fact that you were aware of the losses would go to support our contention that all transactions were effected with your consent and as such we cannot accept your allegation pertaining to unauthorized execution of trades.</span><br />
<span style="line-height:115%">We would like to submit that the primary duty of monitoring investments rests with the customer and not with the broker. A broker basically carries out the instructions of the client and at no point of time can be held responsible for the commissions and omissions of the customer. As a broker we have communicated the details of your transactions and have also apprised you of losses and have cautioned you of the consequences. Having disregarded our notice and having failed to take appropriate decisions at the right time, you are now seeking to hold us responsible for your acts which we believe is not appropriate.</span><br />
