Important Notes:<br />
<br />
1. Initially, the BHC team was operating on Outlook. However, all departments are now working on CRM. Kindly ensure CRM processes are followed to avoid duplication.<br />
&nbsp;2. Before escalating any queries to BHC, ensure the following: Perform basic troubleshooting at your end. Revert with details of<br />
the first-level troubleshooting conducted.<br />
3. To prevent duplication, please share your query either on the WhatsApp group or via email, not both.<br />
4. For audit purposes, avoid calling or texting on personal numbers.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.<br />
